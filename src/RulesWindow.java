			"The four players are in fixed partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other. "
					+ "Deal and play are clockwise. North and South are always partners. East and West are always partners.\n\n",
			"Rank of Cards\n\n",
			"A standard pack of 52 cards is used. The cards, in each suit, rank from highest to "
					+ "lowest: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\n\n",
			"The Start of Game\n\n",
			"The game generates a random number 0-3 to choose the player to start the hand. "
					+ "A new random number is generated at the start of each hand. Play moves to the starting player's left.\n\n",
			"The Bidding\n\n",
			"All four players bid a number of tricks they think they will take. In our version of "
					+ "spades, each player, bot or human, automatically bids the number of spades in their hand. "
					+ "The teams add together the bids of the two partners and that is the total number of tricks "
					+ "the team must win in order to get a positive score. No one can pass on bidding. Bid cannot be changed once made.\n\n"
					+ "Example: West bids 3; North bids 1; East bids 4; South bids 4. The objective of North and South is to win at least 5 ticks "
					+ "(4+1), East and West try to win at least 7 (4+3).\n\n",
			"The Play of the Hand\n\n",
			"The player randomly chosen at the start of the game leads with any card except a "
					+ "spade for the first trick. Each player, in turn, clockwise, must follow suit if able; if unable "
					+ "to follow suit, the player may play any card. A trick containing a spade is won by the highest "
					+ "spade played; if no spade is played, the trick is won by the highest card of the suit led. The winner "
					+ "of each trick leads to the next. Spades may not be led until either some player has played a spade "
					+ "(on the lead of another suit, of course), or the leader has nothing but spades left in hand.\n\n",
			"Scoring\n\n",
			"A side that takes at least as many tricks as its bid calls for receives a score equal to 10 times its bid. "
					+ "Additional tricks (overtricks) are worth an extra one point each. Sandbagging rule: Overtricks are colloquially "
					+ "known as bags. A side which (over several deals) accumulates ten or more bags has 100 points deducted from its score. "
					+ "After 10 bags are accumulated, the counting of bags starts over - that is if they reached twenty overtricks "
					+ "they would lose another 100 points and so on. Example: Suppose a team whose score is 337 bids 5 tricks and they have "
					+ "7 bags carried over from the previous rounds. If they win 7 tricks they score 52, taking their score to 389 (and their "
					+ "bags to 9). If they win 8 tricks they score 53, but lose 100 because they now have 10 bags, and their score becomes "
					+ "290 (337 + 53 - 100). If they win 9 tricks they score 54 and lose 100, bringing their score to 291. If a side "
					+ "does not make its bid, they lose 10 points for each trick they bid. The side which reaches 500 points first wins the game. "
					+ "If both sides reach 500 points in a single deal, the side with the higher score wins.\n\n" };
